<p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) help companies in Singapore meet their
manpower needs by reskilling mid-career new hires and existing employers
for growth jobs in demand.</p>
<p>There are 3 modes of CCPs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1. Place-and-Train:</strong>&nbsp;companies hire jobseekers
and put the individuals through on-the-job training (OJT) or industry-recognised
training to take on a new growth job role.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>2. Attach-and-Train:&nbsp;</strong>companies act as host employers
to provide jobseekers with training and work attachments, in growth job
roles where there are good prospects for placement.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>3. Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling:</strong>&nbsp;companies can send
any existing employee for reskilling to take on new or redesigned job roles
aligned with Industry Transformation Maps/<strong><a href="https://www.wsg.gov.sg/home/employers-industry-partners/jobs-transformation-maps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Jobs Transformation Maps</u></a></strong>.&nbsp;Growth
jobs roles are emerging or good job opportunities with long-term prospects
for progression, identified in each sector in response to how the industry
is expected to transform over time.</p>
