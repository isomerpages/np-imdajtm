<p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) help companies in Singapore meet their
manpower needs by reskilling mid-career new hires and existing employers
for Infocomm Technology (ICT) roles.
<br>
<br>There are 3 modes of CCPs:
<br>&nbsp;1. <strong>Place-and-Train</strong>:&nbsp;companies hire mid-career
jobseekers and put the individuals through on-the-job training (OJT) or
industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>2<strong>. Attach-and-Train:</strong>&nbsp;companies act as host employers
to provide jobseekers with training and work attachments, in growth job
roles where there are good prospects for placement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling</strong>:&nbsp;companies can send
any existing mid-career employee for reskilling to take on new or redesigned
job roles aligned with Industry Transformation Maps/Jobs Transformation
Maps.&nbsp;Growth jobs roles are emerging or good job opportunities with
long-term prospects for progression, identified in each sector in response
to how the industry is expected to transform over time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the Jobs Transformation Map, the Training Partners will help companies
to do job redesign and reskilling for their existing employees to take
on new/redesigned job roles. Do contact any of the <a href="/training-partners/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Training Partners</a> if you wish to find out
