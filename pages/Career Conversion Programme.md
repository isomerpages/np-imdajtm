<p>Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) help companies in Singapore meet their
manpower needs by reskilling mid-career new hires and existing employers
for growth jobs in demand.
<br>
<br>There are 3 modes of CCPs:
<br>&nbsp;1. <strong>Place-and-Train</strong>:&nbsp;companies hire jobseekers
and put the individuals through on-the-job training (OJT) or industry-recognised
training to take on a new growth job role.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>2. <strong>Attach-and-Train</strong>:&nbsp;companies act as host employers
to provide jobseekers with training and work attachments, in growth job
roles where there are good prospects for placement.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>3. <strong>Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling</strong>:&nbsp;companies can send
any existing employee for reskilling to take on new or redesigned job roles
aligned with Industry Transformation Maps/Jobs Transformation Maps.&nbsp;Growth
jobs roles are emerging or good job opportunities with long-term prospects
for progression, identified in each sector in response to how the industry
is expected to transform over time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the Jobs Transformation Map, we are mainly helping companies to
do job redesign and reskilling for their existing employees to take on
new/redesigned job roles. If you are interested, do contact us.</p>
