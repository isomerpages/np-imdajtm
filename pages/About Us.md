the digital economy brings, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.wsg.gov.sg/home/employers-industry-partners/jobs-transformation-maps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">I&amp;C Jobs Transformation Map (JTM)</a></strong>&nbsp;was
published to provide insights into the technologies that are changing the
future of tech jobs and how workers and employers can successfully navigate
these changes through job redesign and reskilling I&amp;C professionals.
IMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA), is a national initiative that aims
to equips individuals with the necessary digital skills and stay competitive.
It also provides employers with guidance in redesigning tech jobs for at-risk
workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to scale up reskilling efforts and help existing tech professionals
stay up to date with the latest technology and changes in their job roles,
IMDA is working with five Training Partners to scale reskilling and upskilling
efforts in AI and Analytics with an emphasis on Generative AI and two other
in-demand areas – Software Engineering and Cloud and Mobility.</p>
<p>The Training Partners are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP),</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMDA will work with the five Training Partners to develop a comprehensive
suite of reskilling courses with relevant and practical training interventions.
The programmes will cater to learners of varying needs, ranging from short-duration
courses to deeper modules that stack towards professional certification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies are invited to come forward to work with the Training Partners
to reskill their existing employees and assistance will be provided to
the companies with training, job redesign and redeployment support incentives.</p>
<p>Through the TeSA framework, the five Training Partners will assist the

partners of WSG’s Career Conversion Programmes to identify their training
