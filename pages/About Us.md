<h2>About Jobs Transformation Map</h2>
<p>Technology is radically transforming the workforce.</p>
<p>To prepare the Information and Communications (I&amp;C) workforce for

launched the Jobs Transformation Map (JTM) for the I&amp;C workforce in
October 2022. The JTM guides employer and tech professionals in navigating
these changes through job redesign and reskilling, to take advantage of
the opportunities. presented by AI and automation. The JTM equips them
with the skills and knowledge to adapt to evolving job requirements and
thrive in the future of work.</p>
<p>To scale up reskilling efforts and help existing tech professionals stay
up to date with the latest technology and changes in their job roles, IMDA
